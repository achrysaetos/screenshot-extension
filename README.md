# LC Chrome Extension

Add your extension to chrome at chrome://extensions/, load unpacked, and select the dist folder.

- `npm run dev` at the root to start the frontend.
- `npm run dev` in backend/ to start the server (currently optional).
- `npm run build` at the root to build the extension every time you make a change.
