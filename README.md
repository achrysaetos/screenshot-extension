# LC Chrome Extension

To set up, add your extension to chrome at [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/), load unpacked, and select the dist folder.

- `npm run dev` at the root to start the frontend.
- `npm run dev` in backend/ to start the server (currently optional).
- `npm run build` at the root to build the extension every time you make a change.
